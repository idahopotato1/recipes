# recipes

A Vue.js SPA to keep track of recipes

Here's an example of the searchable, filterable, recipes list page (the default route):

![List View](./.github/list-view.png)

And this is what it looks like when you open a recipe:

![Detail View](./.github/detail-view.png)

And of course, it's responsive so it looks nice on any screen:

![Mobile View](./.github/mobile-view.png)
